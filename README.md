# Leads Tracker Chrome Extension

This project is a real time, light weight browser extension that can help anyone to save & store the links of important links/leads from internet which can be later visited where they left off. This works like bookmarks but in a better way & can be used with any browser like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Mozilla Firefox, etc. This project has extensive use of following technologies:  
            1. HTML
            2. CSS
            3. JavaScript

During the implimentation of projects I faced lot of challenges in JavaScript as it was my first project in Js. Learnt lot of new things like Local Storage concept and how to use it, etc. during the project itself.

In future this project can be made more interactive where user would be able to create different folders and store related leads in those respective folders. Also, the user experience can be improved and can be made intresting to use by implementing better CSS.
